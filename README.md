# PhyllotaxisAnimator
This application allows you to play with nature's finest visual algorithm! 
Phyllotaxis refers to the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem. 
This is a work in progress and I intend to add audio controls as well.
You can download the code and use index.html to begin.
The best way to get started is to just mess around with sliders. Have fun!
